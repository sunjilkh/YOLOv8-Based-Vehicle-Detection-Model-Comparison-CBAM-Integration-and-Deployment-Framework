# YOLOv8-Based-Vehicle-Detection-Model-Comparison-CBAM-Integration-and-Deployment-Framework
This work presents a comprehensive and empirical benchmark of the entire YOLOv8 model family (nano, small, medium, large) for real-time vehicle detection in Bangladeshi road environments, a setting characterized by high traffic density, heterogeneous vehicle types, and frequent occlusion. To ensure regional relevance, a balanced, context-specific dataset was curated containing 2,170 raw images and 24,826 augmented samples spanning 10 native vehicle categories: bicycle, bus, car, CNG, easy bike, motorcycle, rickshaw, truck, van, and multi-class vehicles. A stratified split was applied to preserve class balance, with 80% for training and 20% for testing.

The models were evaluated using a rigorous set of metrics including mAP@0.50, mAP@0.50–0.95, precision–recall and F1 curves, class-wise performance, and confusion matrices, enabling both global and fine-grained analysis. In addition to baseline YOLOv8 variants, the study investigates the impact of the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM) to assess whether attention improves detection robustness in cluttered scenes.

Results reveal clear performance–efficiency trade-offs. YOLOv8-large achieves the most stable and consistent per-class performance, with high precision, recall, and near-perfect F1 scores for dominant vehicle classes such as cars and motorcycles. In contrast, the lightweight YOLOv8-nano surprisingly delivers the highest overall mAP@0.50–0.95, demonstrating an excellent balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time and resource-constrained deployments. Smaller and occlusion-prone classes, such as rickshaws and easy bikes, remain challenging across variants, highlighting the importance of targeted data augmentation and architectural refinement.

Beyond accuracy, the study systematically measures latency, model size, and runtime efficiency, providing practical guidance on selecting the appropriate YOLOv8 variant for applications such as traffic surveillance, vehicle counting, and speed estimation under South Asian road conditions. Finally, the trained model is deployed using Flask, validating its readiness for real-world integration into intelligent traffic monitoring and control systems.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete, per-class benchmark of the YOLOv8 family on Bangladeshi road imagery, offering both academic insights and deployment-oriented recommendations.
