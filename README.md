# YOLOv8-Based-Vehicle-Detection-Model-Comparison-CBAM-Integration-and-Deployment-Framework
Benchmark of YOLOv8 (n/s/m/l) for vehicle detection on Bangladeshi roads using a region-specific dataset (10 classes). Evaluated with mAP, PR/F1, per-class metrics, and speed–accuracy tradeoffs. YOLOv8-l is most consistent; YOLOv8-n achieves highest mAP with high efficiency. Flask deployment included.
